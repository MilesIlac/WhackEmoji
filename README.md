# WhackEmoji
Applying the basics of Java and Android Studio into a simple whack-a-mole game

## General Info
While watching Youtube tutorials for learning Android app development, I saw one creator show a tic-tac-toe game that he made "on-the-fly" with his friends. This gave me a sudden burst of inspiration and come up with something similar, and that is "WhackEmoji", a whack-a-mole game. Not only this is a game, but also this is the app where I first apply what I learned as a newbie Android programmer.

## Mechanics
* 10 buttons with `(O‿O)` on them.
* If one of them flashes, and turn into `(✦‿✦)`, they become a "mole" and should be clicked within a set interval.
* For a timed game, if you click a mole you get a point, otherwise if you click non-mole buttons you lose a point.
* For an untimed game, clicking non-mole buttons immediately ends the game.
* To help determine if you clicked the mole, a hit mole will flash orange, and a hit non-mole will flash red.
* For a timed game, when the timer at the top-right corner reaches 0, score will be immediately calculated.
